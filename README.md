# Comics as Data: North America
Michigan State University Special Collections is home to the largest collection of print comic in the world, holding more than 300,000 print comic book titles.

This project employs the metadata from the collection to lean more about comics as both an industry and an art form: we aim to investigate how communities of comic creators in the United States context represent their subjects; how genre forms interact with and result from these less represented communities of comics creators; and, how these networksâ€™ interactions are expressed in the visual language of the comic cover artwork from these communities.
